# grvc-ual

A repository for the GRVC UAV abstraction layer.

Master branch should always be last stable version of this software. As packages in this repo are heavily dependent on packages in [grvc-utils](https://github.com/grvcTeam/grvc-utils) and our feelings about git submodules are not clear, make sure you have both repositories updated.

## Installation and use

Download the latest stable version from [here](https://github.com/grvcTeam/grvc-ual/releases).

You can find the instructions for installation and how to use the UAL in the [Wiki](https://github.com/grvcTeam/grvc-ual/wiki).
